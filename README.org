* smart-mark

smart-mark restores cursor position after mark.

For example:

buffer line 1
buffer line 2 cursor is | here
buffer line 3
buffer line 4

when you `mark-whole-buffer`,

\| buffer line 1
buffer line 2
buffer line 3
buffer line 4

the cursor moves to the beginning of the buffer, and you lose the cursor position,

with smart-mark, just press C-g, and the point restore back just where it was.
